# Getting Started

This section discloses the details on how to render and configure a DateTimePicker component in a typescript application.

## Create your first DateTimePicker	

1. Create a Typescript application and refer the dependent modules, script and CSS with the help of given Getting started document.

2. In the index.HTML file, add the input element for rendering DateTimePicker component as given below.

{% highlight html %}

<input id="datetimepick" />

{% endhighlight %} 

3. Create a typescript file named "app.ts" file and refer the required definition files as given below.

{% highlight JS %}

/// <reference path="tsfiles/jquery.d.ts" />
/// <reference path="tsfiles/ej.web.all.d.ts" />

{% endhighlight %} 

4. Now, initialize the DateTimePicker component by using ej.DateTimePicker method. 

{% highlight JS %}

/// <reference path="tsfiles/jquery.d.ts" />
/// <reference path="tsfiles/ej.web.all.d.ts" />

$(function () {
        var sample = new ej.DateTimePicker($("#datetimepick"));
    });

{% endhighlight %} 

### Run the application

To run the application, navigate the project folder and open command prompt window and execute the following command.

{% highlight JS %}

tsc

{% endhighlight %} 

This command compiles the app.ts file to generate a JS file named app.js file. 
Refer the app.js file in index.html and browse the html file to see the following output.

### Configuring DateTimePicker

EJ DateTimePicker provides API through which you can set the maximum and minimum allowed date and time values. Min and Max date and time values can be set at initialization as show below.

{% highlight JS %}

/// <reference path="tsfiles/jquery.d.ts" />
/// <reference path="tsfiles/ej.web.all.d.ts" />

module DateTimePickerComponent {
    $(function () {
        var sample = new ej.DateTimePicker($("#datetimepick"), { minDateTime: new Date("11/1/2016 10:00 AM"), maxDateTime: new Date("11/27/2016 10:00 PM")});
    });
}

{% endhighlight %}
