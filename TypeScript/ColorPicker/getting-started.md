# Getting Started


Using the following steps, you can create a **TypeScript** ColorPicker component.

## Creating an ColorPicker in TypeScript

You can create a **TypeScript** application with the help of the given [TypeScript Getting Started Documentation](https://help.syncfusion.com/js/typescript).

To create a ColorPicker, add a `input` element with the HTML `id` attribute and pre-defined options set to it.

{% highlight html %}

 <input id="colorpick" type="text" />
 <script src="app.js"></script>       

{% endhighlight %}

* Create app.ts file and use the below content

{% highlight js %}

 ///<reference path="jquery.d.ts" />
 ///<reference path="ej.web.all.d.ts" />
      module ColorPickerComponent {
          var colorPickObj = new ej.ColorPicker($("#colorpick"), {
                value: "#278787"
           })
       }        

{% endhighlight %}


* Now build your application, so that the **app.ts** file will compiled and automtically generated the **app.js** file which is added to your project (User have nothing to do with this file). Now, whatever code changes that you make in **app.ts** file will be reflected in app.js file by compiling     build the aplication.

Execution of above code will render the following output.
